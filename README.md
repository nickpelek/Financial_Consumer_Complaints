# Project overview
This data analysis project aims to provide insights into the consumer complaints on financial products and services for a bank of America from 2017 to 2023. By analyzing different aspects of the complaints data, we are looking to **identify trends**, **make data-driven recommendations** and **gain a deeper understanding about the consumer complaints.**

Insights and recommendations will be provided by answering some key questions, such as:
- Do consumer complaints have any seasonal patterns?
- Which States have the most complaints?
- Which products present the most complaints(+ What are their most common issue)?
- How does the company typically resolve the complaints?

## Data Analysis Process (*SQL Queries*)

 >In this section we'll break down the project questions with SQL queries to find some useful insights.


#### - Do consumer complaints have any seasonal patterns?

   ```sql
  SELECT MONTH(date_submitted) AS months, COUNT(*) AS complaints FROM states
  GROUP BY MONTH(date_submitted)
  ORDER BY months;
  ``` 
![query 1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a4cf482b-9308-4076-af58-7cc25dba18c4)
#####  *1 = January, 2 = February, 3 = March, 4 = April , 5 = May, 6 = June, 7 = July, 8 = August, 9 = September , 10 = October,<br> 11 = November, 12 = December*  
> Consumer complaints do have a seasonal pattern, as they start to **increase** from *March* to *July*, followed by subsequent **decrease** in *August*.

#### - Which States have the most complaints?

  ```sql
  SELECT state, COUNT(*) AS total_complaints FROM states
  GROUP BY state
  ORDER BY total_complaints DESC;
  ```
  ![query 2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fdafc747-fcb2-4bed-91cd-0bebb086262d)

> The States with the **most complaints** are:
> - **California (*CA*)**
> - **Florida (*FL*)**
> - **Texas (*TX*)**
> - **New York (*NY*)**
#### - Which products present the most complaints?

  ```sql
  SELECT product, COUNT(complaint_id) AS complaints FROM issues
  GROUP BY product
  ORDER BY complaints DESC;
  ```
  ![query 3](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/925a5b6e-fad3-4481-89b5-0252049e01fc)
>The products with the **most complaints** are: <br> 1) **Checking or Savings account** <br>
                                                 2) **Credit card or prepaid card** <br>
                                                 3) **Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports**
 						

#### - What are its most common **issues**?
     
  ```sql
  SELECT issue , COUNT(issue) AS total_issues FROM issues
  GROUP BY issue
  ORDER BY total_issues DESC;
  ```
  ![query 4](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8098de56-0127-4ba6-ac4d-8cce96215f28)
> The products most common issues are:<br> **1) Managing an account** <br>
										 **2) Incorrect information on your report**<br>
                                         **3) Problem with a purchase shown on your statement**

#### - How does the company typically resolve the complaints?
  ```sql
  WITH total_complaints AS(
	  SELECT company_response_to_consumer, COUNT(complaint_id) AS complaints FROM issues
	  GROUP BY  company_response_to_consumer)
  SELECT company_response_to_consumer, CONCAT(ROUND(complaints/(SELECT count(complaint_id) FROM issues)*100,2), "%") AS percentage_complaints
  FROM total_complaints;
  ```
  ![query 5](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c51b0c85-aa1a-45c9-bbdf-3fc0ad8d68d6)
> A significant majority (*65.65%*) of complaints are resolved through explanation.

## Recommendations
- Anticipate and prepare for **increased** complaint volumes during peak seasons (*March-August*) **by allocating additional resources to customer service departments**.
- Provide **targeted training** to employees in areas with high complaint rates to equip them with the skills and knowledge needed to address these issues effectively.
- Add **technology solutions**, such as **AI-powered chatbots** or **automated complaint resolution systems**, to improve efficiency and reduce human error.
- Develop **educational materials** or **workshops** to help customers better understand their accounts, rights, and responsibilities. This can reduce misunderstandings and potential complaints.
- Actively seek **customer feedback** through surveys or focus groups to gain insights into their experiences and identify pain points.
